Hi guys,

In this folder you'll find the codes for the network mode based on the alternative protocol about which we talk on Friday.

Each folder contains the necessary files to run the program, download the corresponding folder and please be sure that all the libraries are installed in your raspberrypi.

this is my telephone number: +34 691 10 99 24, please contact me if you have any trouble, question or comment to improve the code.

Regards,

Alejandro Parada.
